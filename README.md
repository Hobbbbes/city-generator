# city-generator
c++ city generator with random population

'R' to refresh cities to initial seed
'L' to list currently existing cities
'Y' to merge currently existing cities
'N' to generate new cities
'E' to exit

c++ class/object && function practice project

can't really do much, but it's fun to just generate random cities

city_merge() is also broken
